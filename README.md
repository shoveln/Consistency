# Consistency
[![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/Available%20for_consistency_all.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/consistency)

A Minecraft resource pack that changes some item models from sprites into their block representation. It doesn't package any textures, so it should be compatible with most texture packs.

## Methodology
Every model consists of 3 components:  
- Orientation  
- Model  
- Textures  

Consistency is designed in a modular way, and items like doors use the same model template with different textures. This makes it easy to add new things of the same catagory.
