A Minecraft resource pack that changes some item models from sprites into their block representation. It doesn't package any textures, so it should be compatible with most texture packs.

## Methodology
Every model consists of 3 components:  
- Orientation  
- Model  
- Textures  

Consistency is designed in a modular way, and items like doors use the same model template with different textures. This makes it easy to add new things of the same catagory.

## Installation
Click the download button at the top and click Download ZIP. Unzip the file and move it to your `/resourcepacks` folder.
